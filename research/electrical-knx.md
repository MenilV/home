## Electrical Wiring (In-Floor)

**Requirement:** All wiring in floors (not walls)

---

### Cost Estimate

For ~200m² house with in-floor wiring:

| Item | Cost (KM) | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Rough-in (cables, conduits) | 8,000 | In floor chases |
| Wall boxes, fixtures | 2,000 | During rough-in |
| Switches, outlets | 3,000 | Final installation |
| Electrical panel | 2,500 | Main + subpanels |
| Labor | 5,000 | Electrician |
| **Subtotal Electrical** | **~20,500 KM** | |

**Note:** In-floor wiring is more expensive than wall-mounted due to:
- Floor chasing/concrete work
- More cable length
- Additional protection needs

---

### Specifications

**Must Have:**
- [ ] Main panel: 3-phase, 20kA
- [ ] Subpanels per floor
- [ ] RCD/FI protection on all circuits
- [ ] Surge protection
- [ ] Cat6 cable for data (in addition to power)
- [ ] Coaxial for TV
- [ ] Bus wiring for KNX

**Outlets per room (estimated):**
| Room | Outlets | Switches | Notes |
|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Living room | 8 | 2 | |
| Kitchen | 12 | 2 | High draw appliances |
| Dining | 4 | 1 | |
| Bedroom x4 | 6 each | 2 each | |
| Bathroom x3 | 4 each | 1 each | GFCI needed |
| Office | 6 | 2 | |
| Hallway | 2 | 2 | |
