      <p>
        I started my career as an Android developer in 2009, shortly after getting my first smartphone. 
        What began as curiosity quickly turned into a passion for building software that people actually use.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Over the years, I've worked across wearables, fintech, and e-commerce — leading engineering teams 
        at startups like Teempu (YC W18) and serving as Director of Engineering at a Shopify-focused agency 
        before founding Pear Shadow.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Today, I lead a small but mighty team building mobile apps, Shopify stores, and AI-powered solutions 
        for clients ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies. I believe in "venture building" — treating 
        every project as if it were our own.

      <h2>Speaking</h2>
      
      <p>
        I occasionally speak about technology, leadership, and the creative side of engineering. 
        Most recently, I gave a TEDx talk on "How Tech Can Be Turned Into Art" at TEDxSarajevo Youth.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Writing</h2>
      
      <p>
        I write about software engineering, Kotlin best practices, venture building, and the intersection 
        of technology and creativity. My work has been published on the Nutrient blog and Pear Shadow's Medium publication.
