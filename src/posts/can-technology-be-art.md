Listen for a moment…

*Play five seconds of random phone notifications, chaotic.*

Now listen again.

*Play the same sounds arranged into a short rhythm.*

Same speaker, same sounds. The intent changed. So did the meaning and the emotion you felt.

## What Is Art?

If I ask you to picture art, you'll probably have a mental image of a painting in a museum or a sculpture in stone, or even a dancer on stage. Almost nobody would picture a phone screen, a line of code, or a game controller.

But what if I told you the most powerful brush humanity has ever invented is already in your pocket right now?

When you were a child, you were banging on a wooden xylophone, drawing with crayons, or building a house out of toy blocks. That small act, that first creation, was pure art. Not because it followed any rules, but because it made you feel something new.

Somewhere along the way, most adults forget that. We start to think art belongs in galleries or museums, that it's something rare, elite, or "for the talented." But art was never meant to be exclusive. Art is an experience and, more importantly, a method of expression. It's the human instinct to turn emotion into form.

And that's what art has always done. It stops time long enough for us to feel.

## The Evolution of Art

For centuries, art was easy to recognize. It lived in galleries, on stages, in frames. It had rules and critics and institutions to tell us what counted. But what about technology? That was just a tool. Cold. Functional. Mechanical.

But here's my argument: technology isn't behind art anymore. **Technology is art.**

And once we see it that way, it changes not only how we create, but how we connect to each other.

## A New Definition

According to Webster's Dictionary, art is "the conscious use of skill and creative imagination, especially in the production of aesthetic objects."

But here's a simpler version:

**Art is an intentional craft that moves humans.**

- **Intentional** — you create with purpose
- **Craft** — you shape materials with skill
- **Moves humans** — someone feels something

And what do technologists do? They shape interaction. If paint is pigment on canvas, technology is behavior on canvas. The material is different, but the goal is the same — to move someone.

## When Code Becomes Art

My professional background is in computer science. I deal with numbers, logic, and code. And in the past decade, I've learned that programming doesn't always need to be serious. It doesn't always need to be efficient or practical. Sometimes, code can simply be… art.

Sounds bizarre, right?

Let me introduce you to **esoteric programming languages**, or esolangs. An esolang is a computer programming language designed to experiment with weird ideas, to be hard to program in, or as a joke, rather than for practical use. They're strange, funny, and often absurd ways of programming computers. Not designed to be useful, but to be creative, surprising, and sometimes hilarious.

### Examples of Esoteric Languages

**[Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck)**, for instance, uses only eight symbols to express everything.

**[Chef](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Chef)** makes your code look like a recipe.

There's even **[Piet](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Piet)**, named after the artist Piet Mondrian, where programs are written as colorful abstract paintings.

Or even **[Whitespace](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Whitespace)** — it's all white spaces so you can't really see this piece of art on a white background. Just like you've seen Mona Lisa's hands or two different places Da Vinci used as an inspiration for Mona Lisas' background.

Esolangs challenge what code can be. They make programmers feel like artists again — confused, curious, and amazed. They create "first-time" moments — that same spark of discovery a child feels while drawing, or a traveler feels standing beneath the Sistine Chapel. They remind us that technology can make us feel, not just function.

Remember the example from the beginning of this talk? Those chaotic phone notifications turned into rhythm once intent entered the system. That's what esolangs do. They take chaos, restriction, or absurdity and make meaning from it.

Each of these is a statement, not of utility, but of creativity. They ask, "What if we coded not to solve problems, but to express ideas?" They transform programming from instruction into interpretation.

## The Quine: Code Reflecting on Itself

Now, if you want to see the purest example of programming as art, you need to meet the **quine**.

A quine is a program that outputs its own source code. It's not printing a file. It's not copying. It's creating itself, line by line, symbol by symbol.

A quine is machine reflecting on its own existence.

When you run it, the output is identical to the code you just wrote. It's as if your words turned around and read themselves aloud.

That's not a trick. That's intentional craft that moves humans.

### The Quine Relay

There's even a [quine relay](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay) — a piece of art that starts in one language and when run, outputs code in another language and that one when run outputs code in the next language and so on, 128 times until it reaches the original Ruby language that it started from. You can find it on Github and try it for yourself. Or you can build your own.

## The Future of Digital Art

When we build something new, whether it's a startup, an app, or an esolang that makes no practical sense — we're not just solving problems. We're sculpting experience.

Art is the bridge between feeling and form. Technology is that bridge extended into the digital world. When intent meets imagination, code becomes color.

## Your Canvas Awaits

So the next time you write a function, design an interface, or debug a bug, remember: you're not just building systems. You're composing symphonies of logic. You're painting with electrons.

**You're writing poetry, that just happens to compile.**
