The software industry is at an inflection point. AI coding assistants aren't just autocomplete anymore—they're genuine productivity multipliers. And this changes everything about how we think about team structure.

## The Old Model

Traditional outstaffing followed a simple equation: more developers = more output. Need to ship faster? Add more people. Hit a bottleneck? Scale the team.

But this model has always been flawed. Brooks's Law told us decades ago that adding people to a late project makes it later. Communication overhead grows quadratically. Knowledge gets siloed. Quality suffers.

## The AI Shift

Today's AI tools change the calculus:

- **Junior developers** can produce code that would have required senior review
- **Senior developers** can focus on architecture and mentoring instead of implementation
- **Small teams** can accomplish what used to require large departments

But—and this is crucial—AI doesn't replace human judgment. It amplifies it.

## The Hybrid Team

At Pear Shadow, we're experimenting with what I call "AI-augmented teams":

1. **AI handles the routine** - boilerplate, tests, documentation, refactoring
2. **Humans handle the creative** - architecture, UX decisions, product strategy
3. **Both handle the craft** - code review, quality assurance, continuous improvement

This isn't about replacing people. It's about removing drudgery so humans can do what they do best: think, create, and solve novel problems.

## What This Means for Clients

For businesses buying software development:

- **Smaller teams** can deliver more value
- **Faster iteration** with maintained quality
- **Lower costs** without cutting corners
- **Better outcomes** when humans focus on what matters

## The Challenges

This shift isn't without hurdles:

- **Tooling maturity** varies wildly
- **Training overhead** for effective AI collaboration
- **Quality control** requires new processes
- **Security concerns** with cloud-based AI

## Looking Forward

I believe the future belongs to teams that master human-AI collaboration. Not teams that resist AI, and not teams that blindly trust it. Teams that thoughtfully integrate AI into their workflow, using it to amplify human creativity rather than replace it.

The question isn't "Will AI take our jobs?" It's "How do we build better software with AI as a teammate?"

We're still figuring this out. But I'm excited about what we're learning.
