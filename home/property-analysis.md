## Questions for Wall Analysis

To help with wall planning, I need to know:

1. **Floor distribution:** What rooms are on each floor? (basement, ground, 1st, 2nd)

2. **Wall modifications wanted:**
   - Do you want to remove any walls on ground floor?
   - Open kitchen to living room?
   - Combine rooms?
   - Add doorways?

3. **Load-bearing assessment:** Which walls can be removed?
   - Need structural engineer to determine
   - External walls are likely load-bearing
   - Corridor walls may be removable

4. **Expansion areas:** Where is the 2.5m² per floor expansion?

5. **Current issues:** Are there any walls in bad condition?
