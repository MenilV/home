# Wall Analysis - Pofalići Townhouse

## Current vs Desired Layout

### Ground Floor (Prizemlje)

**Current Layout (from floor plan):**
- 3 separate rooms (Soba 1: 14.70m², Soba 2: 11.55m², Soba 3: 9.00m²)
- Separate kitchen (9.00m²)
- Separate living room (16.20m²)
- Central hallway
- Bathroom (5.85m²)
- Two entrances (Ulaz A, Ulaz B)
- Terrace (14.85m²)

**Desired Layout (from viz images):**
- Kitchen + Dining + Living = OPEN SPACE
- Connected to balcony
- Wall covering stairs to upper floor
- Entrance with small bathroom
- Stairs to basement

---

## Wall Changes Required - Ground Floor

### Walls to REMOVE:
1. **Kitchen wall** - Remove to create open kitchen/dining
2. **Living room walls** - Remove to combine with kitchen/dining
3. **Room partitions** - Remove walls between rooms 1, 2, 3 to create open space
4. **Hallway walls** - May need modification for open flow

### Walls to ADD/Keep:
1. **Stair wall** - Keep wall covering stairs to upper floor (structural?)
2. **Bathroom walls** - Keep/modify for small bathroom
3. **Entrance area** - Keep/create entrance partition

### Questions:
- [ ] Which specific walls are load-bearing?
- [ ] Are the stairs to upper floor structural?
- [ ] What is the current wall material (brick, concrete)?
- [ ] Is the wall covering the stairs load-bearing?

## Expansion - Right Side

**7.5m² total expansion (2.5m² × 3 floors)**

| Floor | Expansion Area | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Ground Floor | 2.5m² | Extend living/kitchen space |
| 1st Floor | 2.5m² | Expand bedroom/office |
| 2nd Floor | 2.5m² | Expand master bedroom/closet |

**Notes:**
- No basement expansion
- Right side (neighbor side)
- Need neighbor agreement

## Upper Floors

### First Floor (1. Sprat)

**Current Layout:**
- Bedroom 1 (largest) with balcony access - ~16m²
- Bedroom 2 - ~14m²
- Small office - ~8m²
- Bathroom (shared)
- Balcony

**Desired Changes:** Keep as is

### Second Floor (2. Sprat)

**Current Layout:**
- Master bedroom with private balcony - ~18m²
- Walk-in closet room - ~8m²
- Bathroom - ~6m²

**Desired Changes:** Keep as is

---

## Basement (Suteren)

**Layout:**
- Access to small garden (90m²)
- Big game room
- Server room - for servers, heat pump elements, electronic switches (KNX hub)
- Small storage unit
- Small laundry room

**Notes:**
- Garden access - good for heat pump outdoor unit placement
- Server room needs good ventilation
- Laundry needs plumbing/drainage

---

## Structural Considerations

### Load-Bearing Wall Indicators:
1. External walls - typically load-bearing
2. Walls perpendicular to floor joists
3. Walls with beams/columns nearby
4. Foundation walls

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Hire structural engineer** to assess
2. **Get as-built drawings** if available
3. **Probe walls** to check construction type
4. **Check for hidden columns/beams**

## Wall Materials (To Verify)

| Area | Likely Material | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| External walls | Brick/concrete | Need to verify thickness |
| Internal walls | Brick/ytong | Standard in BiH |
| Load-bearing | Concrete | May have hidden structure |
| Basement | Concrete | Waterproofing needed? |

---

## Budget Estimate - Wall Work

| Item | Cost (KM) | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Demolition of walls | 2,000 | Labor + disposal |
| Structural assessment | 1,500 | Engineer consultation |
| New wall construction | 3,000 | Where needed |
| Waterproofing | 2,000 | Basement if needed |
| **Subtotal** | **8,500** | |
